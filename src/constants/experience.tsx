              Worked as a mentor for interns. I guided them with new projects and helped them when they had any issues.
              In the summer vacation I worked in a team to create an internal communication tool.
              The tool was used to help our communication team to better cater to the needs of their target audience.

              Worked on two projects at the labs department.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first project was a tool to help shoppers compare the products on nutrition values.
              Users could give food preferences like vegan or more protein and the tool would show the best products.
              I worked on the backend and the frontend of the tool, I especially enjoyed working on the recommendation
              algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second project was an internal tool where we generated extra metadata with AI to help the product search engine.
